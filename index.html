      <h2>About The Rainforests</h2>
      <p>
        Found on every continent except Antarctica, rainforests are ecosystems
        filled with mostly evergreen trees that typically receive high amounts
        of rainfall. Tropical rainforests are found near the equator, with high
        average temperatures and humidity, while temperate rainforests lie
        mostly in coastal, mountainous areas within the mid-latitudes. A
        rainforest is typically made up of four key layers: emergent, upper
        canopy, understory, and forest floor. In the top emergent layer, trees
        as tall as 200 feet (60 meters) grow far apart and tall, their branches
        reaching above the canopy. The upper canopy, a deep layer of vegetation
        roughly 20 feet (6 meters) thick, houses most of the rainforest's animal
        species and forms a roof that blocks most light from reaching below.
        Below the canopy, the understory is a low-light layer dominated by
        shorter plants with broad leaves, such as palms and philodendrons. On
        the dark forest floor, few plants are able to grow and decaying matter
        from the upper layers is prevalent, feeding the roots of the trees.

      <h2>What The Rainforests Does For All Life Forms</h2>
      <p>
        Rainforests are sometimes referred to as the “lungs of the planet.” They
        help absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, stabilize the climate,
        provide a home for plants and animals, and are a source of a staggering
        amount of medicinal plants. In fact, approximately 25 percent of all
        natural medicines have been discovered in rainforests, and about 70
        percent of the plants used in the treatment of cancer by the U.S.
        National Cancer Institute are endemic to rainforests.5 Considering a
        large number of plants that call the rainforest biome their home, there
        are likely thousands more medicinal plants that have yet to be
        discovered or studied. With the rapid depletion of rainforests across
        the globe, beneficial species could go extinct before they can even be
        discovered.

      <h2>Simple Things We Can Do To Help</h2>
      <p>
        One way to save the rainforest? Avoid Palm Oil. Palm oil, found in half
        of all processed foods in the US, and many common household products is
        a key contributor to rainforest deforestation! Read your food and
        product labels carefully and refuse to buy products with palm oil or
        insist on sustainable alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it’s ensuring that your next pair of gold earrings are made from
        recycled gold, or purchasing Marcal’s recycled toilet paper, there are
        purchases anyone can choose to avoid that can save the rainforest.
        Logging is a major driver of long term rainforest destruction. Avoiding
        guitars, furniture and other products made from threatened rainforest
        woods like: Mahogany, Rosewood and Ebony is a great start, but avoiding
        all tropical hardwoods is even better!
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you have a backyard, balcony or window sill, you can help
        migrating birds on their way home. It’s easy and fun! Just plant native
        plants, bird and insect attracting flowers, or even just hang up a bird
        bath or bird house. All of these help migrating birds make it to the
        rainforests of Central and South America. By giving them food water and
        shelter or even just giving the insects they eat a little room to thrive
        you help the amazing migrations that our winged friends make every year.
